## Overview

Published at:  https://tomgalpin.github.io/ia-practice/

This is a practice application with straight JS, JQuery, HTML, & CSS.

# Goals & Notes:
- Note:  I used Github instead of Codepen because the screen size for Codepen is a bit too small for me and sometimes drives me crazy moving everything around in there.
- Note:  Also, I wanted to add some additiona functionality.
- Note:  Of note, I was unable to use the font "rooney-sans", Avenir-Book.  Because of this some of the font sizing and spacing is a touch off.
- Goal:  Recreate pixel-perfect a widget from an image.
- Goal:  Set up simple click events.
- Goal:  Create a modal that is filled with different data from different events.
- Goal:  Save input to local storage.
- Goal:  Create an input field that parses an array and returns an array of only uniques.
